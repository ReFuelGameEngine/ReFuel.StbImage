Quik.StbImage
=============
Quik.StbImage is a binary distribution of the popular stb_image.h single header
library. Existing packages were either bad source ports, had odd wrappers or
weren't up to date.

Originally intended for my own purposes, however feel free to view the code at
https://git.mixedup.dev/QUIK/Quik.StbImage, and shoot me patch files through
email.
